# Capistrano 3 Monit Wrapper

## Usage

Add the gem to your Gemfile

    gem 'capistrano3-monit', github: 'naps62/capistrano3-monit'

Run `bundle` to update your `Gemfile.lock`
Add the following to your `Capfile`:

    require 'capistrano/monit'

The following tasks will be available to you:

    monit:status    # shows the output of running `monit status` on the server
    monit:start     # sends a start signal to all monitored processes
    monit:stop      # sends a stop signal to all monitored processes
    monit:restart   # sends a restart signal to all monitored processes
    monit:monitor   # enable monitoring of all processes
    monit:unmonitor # disable monitoring of all processes

Tasks `monit:...` are not called automatically. You should add them in your
deploy.rb. For example,

    before 'deploy:starting', 'monit:unmonitor'
    after 'deploy:restart', 'monit:update'
    after 'deploy:restart', 'monit:reload_service'
    after 'deploy:restart', 'monit:monitor'

Currently, the `start|stop|restart|monitor|unmonitor` tasks assume you only
want to handle monitored processes related to the app being deployed. For this,
the name of each process should contain the name of the application. For
example, if you have the following configuration for your production stage:

    # config/deploy/production.rb
    set :application, 'production'

And if `monit:status` returns the following output:

    Process 'production-puma'
      status             Does not exist
      monitoring status  Monitored
      data collected     Wed, 04 Dec 2013 23:24:51

    Process 'production-redis'
      status             Does not exist
      monitoring status  Monitored
      data collected     Wed, 04 Dec 2013 23:24:51

    Process 'staging-puma'
      status             Does not exist
      monitoring status  Monitored
      data collected     Wed, 04 Dec 2013 23:24:51

    Process 'staging-redis'
      status             Does not exist
      monitoring status  Monitored
      data collected     Wed, 04 Dec 2013 23:24:51

Then launching the `monit:start` task will only handle the `production-puma`
and `production-redis` processes.

# TODO

* Add tasks to manage the monit service itself
* Allow a customizable list of processes to manage, instead of making
  assumptions based on their names
